# web-dev-starter

This is a starter project for web development with no frameworks and minimal
dependencies. It is intended to be a starting point for web development projects
that are written in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

## Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project
locally. This will allow you to see changes in real-time as you make them. There
is no need to run a build process or refresh the page manually. Additionally,
you do not need to setup a local server to run the project.

## Testing

To run the tests for the project, run the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Documentation

When the site is running, you should be able to test the following features:

A Hello World button that shows an alert with the text “Hello World” and also prints the same message to the browser console.

An Add Numbers form where you can enter two numbers and click the button to see their sum displayed on the page.

A Random Joke button that fetches a single random joke from the Official Joke API and displays it on the page.

A Five Jokes button that fetches five jokes from the API and displays them neatly in a table.

An About Page that contains information about me.
